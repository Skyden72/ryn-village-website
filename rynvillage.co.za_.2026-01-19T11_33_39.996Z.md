## Professional Estate Management

Our estate is managed in-house by an experienced team.

It is our responsibility to see to the irrigation and care of the landscaped communal gardens; to see to all maintenance issues, such as normal repairs and plumbing; to keep the Ryn Village environment clean and tidy, to provide terrific club house facilities; and to see to all your reasonable needs.

None of this is at your cost.

## Financial Security

Life rights offer significant financial benefits. You save 30%–50% on upfront costs compared to full ownership, allowing you to allocate these savings elsewhere.

Because you do not have to take transfer, you do not pay transfer duties or fees; you do not pay VAT. Add this saving to your bank account.

You have all the advantages of ownership but you do not have to pay to maintain your home; if there is a leak, it is not your problem; we pay to fix it. A plumbing issue, call us. No charge.

The levy excludes all maintenance costs; it covers what you use in your own home, water, gas, and electricity which is pre-paid, and we are on solar so no outages to deal with. It includes a contribution to security, and to frail care

Moreover we will always provide an accurate estimate of your levy amounts for two years in advance so you can rest assured that your budget can safely be planned with no nasty surprises in store.

Importantly, at Ryn Village you will never have to pay a special levy. As a Life Rights holder, you are protected from unforseen ownership expenses, an attractive option if you are living on a fixed retirement income.

## Life Rights

Purchasing a life right grants you the legal right to live in your home for life, along with your partner if applicable.

Life rights are much cheaper than buying a unit; usually between 30% and 50% less expensive.The owner pays for maintenance, not you, because you are not the owner. The life rights model means that we as the Developer always have the same interests as you the legal occupier.  It is not like sectional title ownership. We do not walk away when the units are built.  Since the units belong to the Developer they are our assets and we must keep them up and maintain them in our own interest. Keeping the property and communal facilities in immaculate condition protects their value, thus ensuring you live in a well maintained estate at all times.
